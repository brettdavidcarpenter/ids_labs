# IDS Labs Version 2.0 (Python)

These labs were originally written for use with the new LAUSD Introduction to Data Science (IDS) math course. Edits, changes and additions will be made throughout the year. I'm contributing to this project by translating the labs to python.

To use these labs, you'll need a copy of [Rstudio](www.rstudio.com) and install the `mobilizr` package. To install the package, run:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('jimmylovestea/mobilizr')
```

To view the labs in the *Viewer* pane in Rstudio, run the `load_labs()` function and then select the lab you'd like to look at.

Of course, you could always just look in the folders at the `.html` files as well. That'd work.
